This repository includes Stata do.files developed by the Evans School Policy Analysis & Research Group (EPAR) for the construction of a set of land tenure indicators using data from the World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Study - Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) surveys. These files were developed as part of the EPAR Land Tenure Technologies and Indicators project: https://evans.uw.edu/policy-impact/epar/research/review-land-tenure-technologies-and-indicators 

Code is currently available for 10 survey instruments:
 * Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS) Wave 3, 2015/16 (LSMS-ISA)
 * Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS) Wave 2, 2013/14 (LSMS-ISA)
 * Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey (ESS) Wave 1, 2011/12 (LSMS-ISA)
 * Nigeria General Household Survey-Panel (GHSP) Wave 3, 2015/16 (LSMS-ISA)
 * Nigeria General Household Survey-Panel (GHSP) Wave 2, 2012/13 (LSMS-ISA)
 * Nigeria General Household Survey-Panel (GHSP) Wave 1, 2010/11 (LSMS-ISA)
 * Tanzania National Panel Survey (TNPS) Wave 4, 2014/15 (LSMS-ISA)		
 * Tanzania National Panel Survey (TNPS) Wave 3, 2012/13 (LSMS-ISA)
 * Tanzania National Panel Survey (TNPS) Wave 2, 2010/11 (LSMS-ISA)
 * Tanzania National Panel Survey (TNPS) Wave 1, 2008/09 (LSMS-ISA)

The .do files include all of the code used to generate the final set of indicators from the raw survey data for a given survey wave. See the USER GUIDE file in this repository for guidance on how to download the files in this repository and raw data available from the World Bank in order to run the .do files. The .do files create indicators used in generating our summary statistics, as well as a few other related land tenure indicators at the plot, household, and community levels.
